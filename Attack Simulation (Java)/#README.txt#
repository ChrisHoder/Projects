For my project I chose to simulate a group of Attackers raiding a Castle which is defended by Defenders. This simulation is based off of the Tower defense game as well as the stick castle defense game, http://www.castledefense.org/game/5/Stick_Castle_Defense.html. Although to make the coding assignment some of the rules and interactions were simplified. The layout of the game is simple. We have a Castle wall on the right side of the Landscape. This castle has a given health. An assorted amount of defenders are placed on the right and shoot bullets at oncoming attackers. An infinitely large amount of attackers feed in from the left with varying speed and health. The attackers travel horizontally and when they get within 1 unit of the castle, they begin to attack the castle.
