% Laboratory 4 Question 2

% this method can be used to solve the linkage problem in  question 3 
% using Newton's method for
% systems of nonlinear equations. theta is a vector of the initial
% conditions for theta2 and theta3. tol is the tolerance we want to know
% the root to. nMax is the maximum number of iterations. This uses the
% inversion of the Jacobian. This will return thetaN which contains a
% matrix where the first column is theta2 the 2nd is theta3. the iteration
% number is the row number where the iterations start at 1.
%
% Some changes have been made to this code, it now inputs theta4 and the
% linkage lengths so that it can be adapted for Lab4 Q2
