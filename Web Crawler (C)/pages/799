<h4>About CSRS</h4>
The Dartmouth Computer Science Research Symposium is an annual exhibition
of the research being conducted in the field of Computer Science here
at Dartmouth. It not only provides a means of communicating research
interests and goals to fellow department members, but to the greater
Dartmouth community as well. Students and faculty are given an opportunity
to present their research either in the form of a presentation, in a 
comprehensive poster session, or in the form of working demonstrations. 
CSRS serves to strengthen the solidarity of our department, provide critical
presentation experience, and widen perspectives of Computer Science
among both students and faculty.
<p>

Every year, the symposium features a keynote talk given by a distinguished member of the
field from outside Dartmouth College.  This year, our keynote speaker is <a href=http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~kaashoek/>Frans Kaashoek</a> of MIT.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please see the <a href="schedule.html#keynote">Program</a> page for more details.

<br><h4>Note</h4>
We will be presenting the Patrick Tsang Best Student Talk award and the Patrick Tsang Best Student Poster award.  These awards will be determined by faculty committee and announced at the end of the day.
