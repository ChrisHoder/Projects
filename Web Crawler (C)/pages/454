  Dear author<br><br>

This mail reaches you as you are the first author of the paper published with Wiley/Blackwell and also stored in the EG DL under<br><br>

      http://www.eg.org/EG/DL/CGF/volume29/issue4/PDF/v29i4pp1451-1459.pdf<br><br>

In order to have you paper published you did sign the Exclusive License Form (ELF) with Wiley/Blackwell and Eurographics which explicitly states that you must NOT make this paper freely available within the blockout period of 12 months.<br><br>

The fact that you do offer this paper at<br><br>

      http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~fabio/papers/bendylight10.pdf<br><br>

is a clear violation of the signed ELF.<br><br>

Not only do you violate a contract signed by yourself you also bring Eurographics in a critical situation.<br><br>

As you might have noticed Eurographics was one of the first Associations to convince the publisher to follow what is nowadays called the 'green route'.<br><br>

I.e., to let the authors keep the (c) and allow a free distribution of the material after the embargo period is over.<br><br>

And there is no doubt that publishers need to generate income somewhere in return for the services they render to the community - like catering for the wide distribution and availability of DOI assigned material (to name only two items on a relatively long list).<br><br>

If authors publishing at Eurographics events do not adhere to the agreed contracts the publisher has the right to cancel the current agreement - a situation which Eurographics considers disadvantageous for the research community in general and for Eurographics' authors in particular.<br><br>

Thus, on behalf of the Publications Board of Eurographics I demand that you stop the free distribution of the respective paper until the embargo period has lapsed.<br><br>

Please confirm the deletion of the paper at the above URL at your earliest convenience<br><br>

Thanks for your understanding<br><br>

Dieter Fellner<br><br>
