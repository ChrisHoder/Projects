<h2>Course description</h2> 

<p>This course provides an overview of computing and computer science.
To get a taste of how computers represent and process information, we
will learn to create static web pages using html, and to develop
interactive and dynamic pages using javascript.  We will also cut a
broad swath through topics in computer science, from how the
world-wide web works all the way down to how a computer manipulates
individual zeros and ones, along with how we can put computers to use
in making movies, deciphering the genome, and so forth.</p>

<h2>Coursework</h2>

<p>Coursework will include homeworks (30% total), along with a midterm
(35%) and final (35%).</p>

<p>There will be weekly homeworks, assigned one Monday and due
<em>before</em> class the following Monday.  Ample time is provided
for each assignment, so in general, late submissions will not be
accepted for credit.  Under extenuating circumstances (prolonged
illness, death in the family, etc.), arrangements must be made with
the instructor <em>before</em> the due date.</p>

<p>Assignments are to be turned in via <a
 href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~blackboard/">Blackboard</a>.
Acceptable formats for written questions are HTML, PDF, plain text,
rich text format (RTF), and Word.  Some homework questions will
require the creation of web pages; web pages are also acceptable for
standard written questions.  For web pages, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In each web page, include a time-stamp to prove that it was
  completed on time.  Insert the following just before the closing
  <tt>&lt;/body&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;/html&gt;</tt> tags at the end of
  your file.  (<a href="timestamp.html">An example time-stamped
  file.</a>)
<pre>
&lt;p&gt;Last modified: &lt;em&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;document.write(document.lastModified);&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
  </li>

  <li>Upload your web pages to a "hidden" folder in your <a
  href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Eapply">personal web
  space</a>.  Name this hidden folder with a codeword of 6&mdash;8
  different letters/numbers (e.g., 5yo3ee), so that nobody will
  casually stumble upon it.</li>

  <li>As part of your homework submission on Blackboard, provide in the text
  area the <em>full</em> URL of each web page (e.g., <a
   href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~cbk/5yo3ee/test.html">http://www.dartmouth.edu/~cbk/5yo3ee/test.html</a>).
  Be sure to include the name of the hidden folder.</li> 
</ul>

<p>Web pages will be graded according to how they work with the <a
href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/personal.html">Firefox
3</a> web browser.  Since there are differences between the various
browsers, you should install Firefox or use a lab computer, in order
to ensure that the TAs will see you what you want them to.  To help
find errors in your pages, you might find the <a
href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843">firebug add-on</a>
quite helpful.</p>

<p>The exams will test your comprehension of what you have done on the homeworks.
They will be closed-book / closed-computer.</p>

<a name="honor"></a>
<h2>Honor code</h2>

<p><strong>Please read this part carefully and make sure that you
understand it. If there is even the remotest uncertainty of what does
and does not constitute a violation of the honor code, ask
me.</strong></p>

<p>You cannot collaborate or copy in any way on exams.</p>

<p>On the computer programming portion of homeworks, you may discuss
general approaches with other students before you sit down at the
computer to write code. Once you are writing code, however, your code
must be written by you: any copying (electronic or otherwise) of
another person's code or code fragments is a violation of the honor
code &mdash; this includes code from any web page (other than our
class web page) that you find on the web. In addition, you may not use
software that generates web code for you (e.g., MS Word).</p>

<p>On the written portion of homeworks, you may discuss general
approaches with other students before you sit down to write out your
solutions. Once you are writing your solutions, however, your work
must be your own: any copying of another person's solution, or
portions of their solution, is a violation of the honor code &mdash; this
includes solutions from any web page (other than our class web page)
that you find on the web.</p>

<p>You must reference all sources of help and collaboration on each
homework. For example, if you talked with Jane Smith about your
homework (in any way), you must note this on your homework. If you
used a source outside of one provided by me or the class web page, you
must cite it on your homework. Not doing so is a violation of the
honor code.</p>

<a name="access"></a>
<h2>Disabilities</h2>

<p>Students with disabilities enrolled in this course and who may need
disability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to make an
appointment to see the instructor before the end of the second week of
the term. All discussions will remain confidential, although the <a
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~accessibility/">Student Accessibility
Services</a> office may be consulted to discuss appropriate
implementation of any accommodation requested.</p>
