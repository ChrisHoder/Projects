<li>
Early Romantic guitar by Al. Seugrabi of Naples, Italy.<br>
  No date, but probably
   from the mid- to late-1800's.  The label is clearly legible and reads: FABRICA
   D'INSTRUMENTI ARMONICHI / Al. Seugrabi / 4, VIA UMBERTO, 4 / NAPOLI /
   Representant pour la France / BARGUES A BORDEAUX.  Spruce top, sycamore back
   and sides, all solid. Very beautiful instrument, but it is far from pristine.
    Signs of alterations: the bridge is clearly not original; the outline of a
   previous bridge is visible.  Also, it appears that this had a tail piece at
   one point.  It has been professionally restored; its many cracks have been
   repaired and are all stable.  I had it set up to be perfectly playable... the
   neck is dead straight, the original brass frets are good, with good intonation
   and no excessive buzzing anywhere; low action.  The string length is quite
   short at 60cm.  Because of the short scale, with the right strings, it could
   be strung up to be played as a terz guitar.  It's equipped with Pegheds, which
   are geared tuners that are made to look like wooden friction pegs (more on
   pegheds here: http://www.pegheds.com/).  Email me for mp3 samples.  $1200 plus
   shipping; ships with hardshell case.<br>

2000 Cezar Mateus 6 course vihuela, pear/maple back & sides - 61cm<br>
in excellent condition and supplied with custom kingham case
and are particularly well suited for professional performance, solo or 
ensemble work where being heard & musical counts! I've performed and 
recorded with these all over the US and have always had enthusiastic 
reaction to them from audiences, musicians and even arts presenters. At 
my Boston Early Music Festival fringe vihuela concert in 2009 a reviewer 
wrote: /I would give a lot to someday get my vihuela to sound like that/ 
... Sure, I was the one playing it.. but I give the credit to Cezar's 
instruments which have the capacity for translating and empowering every 
musical gesture (both large and small) that a player might have.... 
making them a joy and inspiration to play.<br>

I'll be using the funds from these instruments towards an amazing Mateus

10-course, 62 cm. Larry Brown lute for sale from around 2000<br>
(the inside
   label has no date, and I can't remember exactly when I bought it). The
   top was rethicknessed by Mel Wong in 2009, which greatly improved the
   sound, and a panel insert added to the fingerboard as decoration. I
   believe Larry was selling this lute for 2400 USD without case when he
   retired from lute building, and I paid an extra 200 dollars for a yew
   back. Improvements by Mel Wong ran about 2000 dollars. Comes with a
   custom fitted Kingham Case (around 300 dollars). All in all, I have about
   5000 dollars invested in this instrument but am selling it for 2700
   dollars because of some repairs that had to be made recently. Details of
   repairs available upon request. You can hear over 100 samples of how this
instrument sounds strung in gut at
<a href="http://lutegroup.ning.com/profile/StephenArndt">
http://lutegroup.ning.com/profile/StephenArnd</a>t<br>
(you may have to sign
   in). It is currently strung in a combination of synthetics.<br>

For sale is an 8 course renaissance lute. <br>

The label inside says: <br>

Richard Fletcher <br>
Roaring Branch <br>
1982 <br>
Repaired in Baltimore <br>
by David Brown <br>
1991 <br>

Lute is in playable condition. Last winter I experienced a humidification issue, and the result was a slight bow in front of the bridge. There is also a small crack at the edge of the soundboard near the lower bout area. It has been stored with the strings relieved of tension (the pictures were also taken with the strings loosened). Has gut frets. Needs new strings. Comes with custom padded case. <br>
Asking 1500 US dollars or best offer. <br>

Original 18th century Baroque guitar<br>
This guitar has been attributed to Champion. (it is Photographed, and discussed
 as such  in Gram Wade's book on early Guitars.) It is in remarkable playing 
condtion, many players and Builders have been very impressed with its sonority 
and condition. It has formerly been a part of the Forder  collection and can be 
seen and heard on his YouTube  video.
 The tone is better than any modern replica I have heard, particularly on 
strumming.
I offer it at  $9500, and am open to part trade for a good modern Vihuela
and or Baroque guitar, and or lute and am interested in instrument by
Gool Lourdes Biffin, and others.<br>

Viola da mano, made by Alan Arthur Suits. I built this some time back in
   St Louis, a swamp, and moved to high desert Santa Fe. The top split from
   the  local dryness in several places but I've shimmed all the cracks
   nicely and it has remained super-stable since. Beautful tone and
   playability. No case .$ 2500 FIRM includes packing/shipping in USA.

<h2><a name="wanted"></a>Lutes Wanted</h2>
(be sure to read about <a href="#fraud"> lute scams </a>as people
are now pretending to sell instruments too!)<p>
<ul>
<li>
I am interested in purchasing a French theorbo, in 'A', by a reputable maker.  The stopped-string length should be ca. 78-80 cm with diapasons at a 2-1 ratio (preferably), and feature a 7/7 string arrangement.  The instrument must reside in the Northern Hemisphere and must be repair- and crack-free.  Necks and pegboxes must be veneered in ebony (not painted black); top must be European spruce; hard-wood bowl is preferable but will consider other alternatives.
Please contact Bruce (jetjag97@aol.com).

I'd like to buy a theorbo.  Best if I can try it.  I'll drive 
anywhere between Washington D.C. and Boston.
I'd like to find something for around $3000.
I would buy one from abroad if I could be sure that the instrument is decent.

Stolen lute. The lute in
  question belongs to Marianne Buisseret, Hofstraat 247, 9000 Ghent, Belgium
  (tel: 00 32 9225 9576 contact email: lieven.misschaert@worldonline.be) and
  was recently stolen in Belgium from a lute maker's car. It was on its way to
  be cleaned up so it won't look as pristine as in the photographs, which were
  taken when it was made in 1984.

I'm writing to ask that everyone be on the lookout for a baroque guitar (5
courses) belonging to Lucas Harris in NY.
It was left accidently on the Long Island Rail Road and was taken by someone
on the train. 
It has snakewood back and sides, a red and white rose with the center part
missing so you can actually see the label, which says Ivo Romano 1996, I
believe.  It has a vaulted back.<br>

<a name="howto"></a><h3>How to post an ad</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Send your postings for lutes for sale, or lutes wanted, to
wbc&#64;cs&#046;dartmouth&#046;edu and be sure to include your address (including
country) and phone number.
You also must include an e-mail address where I can reach you.
Please send your ad in plain text format, not in html format!
I generally do not reply to you unless I need more information
but
I try and insert and delete ads as soon as I get them.  
I will delete the ads after roughly one year.
<li>
If you send pictures, try and crop them close to the instrument so people don't
have to wait to download extra picture that they don't need.  
A 200,000 byte picture will take over thirty seconds to download
on a modem connection!
Be sure the pictures are in focus.  Take a few moments to check
in detail.  
Cameras focus better in bright light, so consider taking your
pictures outdoors.
Look at what is in the background of the picture too!
You might not want your dirty laundry in the picture.
It helps if the
names of the pictures don't have any spaces in them.  Use
"baroque-lute.jpg" or "baroqueLute.jpg" instead of "baroque lute.jpg".
If you take a close up picture of the rosette be sure that it is in focus.
<li>
If you are not writing in english, please either use html characters
for accents ( as &amp;eacute;  for &eacute;) or spell it out ( o with " over it, &ouml; )
or use tex symbols ( \'a, &aacute; ) as my word processor does not
recognise accents.  Since I post these ads in my very hard to
come by free moments, it would help me if you send the ad as
"text/plain" format.  If I can't read your ad I will ask you
to re-submit it.
<li> 
If you want to change something, please send me the changes, not the whole ad.
If you say "change the price from 4500 to 4200" or "add a line
that says  ..." I can quickly make the change.  If you send me
a new ad I have to look through the new and old versions to find
the differences, and I may miss something.  If I already have the pictures
please don't send them again!
<li>
I have a very hard time decoding Microsoft Word documents - please send your ad as plain text!
<li>
Please type out the monitary units, as in "yen", "krone", "euro",
or "dollars" as my computer can't read the special symbols that many
people use for money.  If you type in the characters &#38;yen&#59;
you will get a &yen;, and the characters &#38;euro&#59; will 
print &euro;.  The &#38; (ampersand) and &#59; (semicolon) are 
required.  ( if your are british &#38;#163; or &#38;pound; {include the semicolon} will produce the &#163; sign.)
<li>
I use spam filters, if you message looks a lot like spam (html format, 
all capital letters, etc) I may not get it.  If the ad doesn't show up try sending 
it again using plain text, lowercase letters, and a Subject that says
"lute for sale" clearly.
<li>
If you are a professional builder you may list lutes that you currently
have on hand for immediate sale.  Please tell me when the instrument
is sold.
<a name="string"></a>
<li>
This service is free, but if you feel grateful to me for having
found or sold your lute, you can send a 
<a href="payment.html">contribution</a> to
Wayne Cripps, 6211 Sudikoff Lab., Hanover, N.H. 03755 USA.
Please make checks payable to "Wayne Cripps", as the bank gets
upset when I try to cash checks made out to "string fund."
Foreign currencies (cash, not checks) are gladly accepted.
(I seem to be collecting euros now.)
<li>
I tend to change usage to American English without notification.
<li>
Send any questions about the instruments listed here directly 
to the owners.  In some cases, the owners do not have e-mail and
you will have to use the phone or even write to them!
<li>
Please be sure to tell me if you do not want me to list your complete name and
address information.  
It is helpful if people know what country and state the instrument
is in, but it might be safer to omit your street address. 
You should check your ad once I have inserted it.
You might want to consider opening a special email account 
for selling your lute, as you will get mail from Nigerian 
criminals.  It may take a year to sell your lute, and you may
be getting several Nigerian Scam messages a day!
</ul>
<a name="fraud"></a>
<h4>Warning! the Nigerian Fraud has hit the lute world! </h4>
Criminals from Nigeria are contacting people who advertise on this list,
asking to buy a lute with a check for thousands of dollars over
the price of the
lute and have the seller wire the remaining money to Nigeria.
Don't do it - the check will be forged and will bounce -
this is a way to steal your money!   They all seem to know about this 
"Lutes for Sale" list and they <em>will</em> contact you.

You may want to get yourself a temporary email address to use just for
selling your lute, so that your regular email is not filled with
messages from people running this scam.
<p>
Here are some signs of fraud:
<ul>
<li>If someone wants to send a check for more than the cost of the instrument and shipping, and wants you to send cash back to them with the instrument for "tax reasons".  The check will bounce and you will be out the money and your instrument.  Even if the bank accepts the check, they will come after you for the money weeks later when they find it is forged.
<li>If someone will deliver a check by courier.  In the USA mail fraud is a serious crime and  thieves use FedEx and Western Union so they won't be investigated and prosecuted by the Post Service.
<li>Watch out for forged bank checks.  If you are suspicious wait a few weeks to be sure that it clears.  Talk to someone at your bank about this.
<li>If someone is buying a lute for somebody else as a present.  Perhaps 
a rich uncle buying something for his nephew.  Or perhaps the person
is acting as an agent.  How many lute players would have an agent
buy a lute for them?  Really!  (watch out for "Mark Luke")
<li>If a third party, not the buyer, is supposed to send the check because
he owes the buyer money.
<li>If someone doesn't ask the usual lute player questions about the age, condition,
and string dimensions, and doesn't ask for pictures.  If someone says
they saw your lute and it is acceptable.  If they don't even mention
lutes, but just ask for information about the article you are selling.
<li>If someone seems to have difficulty writing the language of the
country they claim to come from.
<li>Check the person out on google!  Do they have a lute page or are there complaints about them selligng motorcycles that they don't own?
<li>Note also that Indonesia is known for credit card fraud.  Be extremely
cautious when selling something to be paid for with an Indonesian card!
<p>
<a href="sales-rules.html">Here</a>
 is a 
<a href="sales-rules.html">letter </a>that you can send to a prospective buyer if you have any
reason to be suspicious....
