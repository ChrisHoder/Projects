<h1>August 11: More Microarchitecture</h1>

<hr><h2>0) Recap</h2><hr> 

In the first half of this course, we went from electricity all the way
up to the instruction set.  This past week or two, we've been looking
at a representative high-level programming language (C), and how it
interfaces with the architecture.  

<p>Last class, we completed our discussion of C and talked about the
LC-3 datapath (especially as it pertained to homework 5) and
the <i>microarchitecture</i>.

<p>Today we'll continue looking into the microarchitecture, but in a
more in-depth fashion.



<hr><h2>1) Reviewing the FSM Hardware</h2><hr>

<p>
Here are the book's figures again.

<p>

<hr><p>State</p>

The LC-3 FSM has <b>52</b> different states.  Thus, we need <b>6
bits</b> to describe the state, since 2^5 < 52 < 2^6.

<p>ROM contains the <b>control store</b>.  There's a microinstruction
for each state.

<p>There are <b>49</b> different signals we need to take care of in
the LC-3.  Hence, each microinstruction is <b>49 bits</b>.

<p>We can divide this microinstruction into at least three parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>the ones that control the valves (<b>GateMDR, ALUK0, MIO.EN, ...</b>)
<li>the ones that clock registers/flip-flops (<b>LD.MAR, LD.REG, ...</b>)
<li>the ones that help determine which state to go to next (<b>J[5:0],
COND[2:0], IRD</b>)
</ul>

<p>The microsequencer figures out where to go next based on these last
ten bits (J,COND, IRD) and some other signals from the datapath (INT,
R, IR[15:12],...)


<hr><h2>2) Looking at some states</h2><hr>

Let's consider the JMP instruction:
