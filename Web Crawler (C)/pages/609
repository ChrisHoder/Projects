<h2>Nick Foti</h2>
<p>
I am a fourth year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Dartmouth College.
</p>

<p>
My research interests include machine learning and statistical methods 
and applying them to time-evolving complex systems.<br>
I am currently 
interested in applying Bayesian methods (parametric and nonparametric) 
to dynamic networks and data from <br>
finance and econometrics. Additionally, 
I study efficient learning and inference algorithms for these methods.
