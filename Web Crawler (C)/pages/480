We'll continue our exploration of the hardware/software interface,
but this time, look at C as well.

<h2>Q1</h2>(25 points)
<hr>
<p>
As pointed out in class, the LC-3 has nothing in its
ISA that's close to a "right shift."   How does the compiler
get it to perform operation such as:
<pre>
int x = 0x000F;
int z;

main() {

  z = x >> 1;

}
</pre>
<p>

<h2>Q2</h2>(25 points)
<hr>
<p>
In class and on the midterm, we've seen an assembly routine for
multiply that was rather inefficient, and we've discussed that more
efficient schemes exist.  Implement one (but in C, not assembler, to
make your life easier).
<p>
(No, you can't actually USE "*" in your solution. :)

<h2>Q3</h2>(25 points)
<hr>
<p>
Re-do the calendar program from HW4... but do it in C (for the LC-3).
<p>
<hr>
<h2>Q3.5</h2>(10 points)
<hr>
Compare and contrast:
<ul>
<li> the <i>process</i> of producing your program for Q3
above with that of producing the assembler version
<li> ...and the resulting assembler to your assembler
</ul>
<p>
<hr>
<h2>Q4</h2>(15 points)
<hr>
<p>
We've seen how priority encoders could be used to select which
interrupt request to forward to the CPU, and we've also seen how it
might be useful if you want to implement some elegant Push/Pop
instructions.  

<p>For this question, you should implement a <b>priority encoder</b>
in Logisim.  Here's what it should have:

<p><b>Inputs:</b>
<ul><li>Eight one-bit inputs P0,P1,...,P7</ul>

<b>Outputs:</b>
<ul>
<li>a three bit line Q.  Q will equal the highest <i>set</i> input bit.  If no input bit is set, Q will be open.
<li>one bit line group_select:  This is zero if all inputs are zero, and one otherwise.
</ul>

<p>For this problem, you can use anything from the Base and Gate
libraries.  As always, provide a test harness so Ranga and James can
see you've tested it.  Note that Logisim gives you a priority encoder
component, so for this question testing should be easy.

 Send email to cs37staff@cs with the subject line "Homework 6
 Submitted".  Attach all relevant files.  If you use multiple files,
 packing the assignment into a single zip file is preferred.
