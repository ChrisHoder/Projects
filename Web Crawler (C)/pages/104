<h2>Course description</h2> 

<p>Computation is vital for modern molecular biology, helping
scientists to model, predict the behaviors of, and control the
molecular machinery of the cell.  This course will study algorithmic
challenges in analyzing biomolecular <i>sequences</i> (what genes
encode an organism, and how are genes related across organisms?),
<i>structures</i> (what do the proteins constructed for these genes
look like, and what does that tell us about their mechanisms?), and
<i>functions</i> (what do these things do, and how do they interact
with each other in doing it?).  The course is application-driven, but
focused on the underlying algorithms and information processing
techniques, employing approaches from search, optimization, pattern
recognition, and so forth.</p>

<dt>Textbook</dt> 
<dd>None required.  While there are several great
books out there covering some of the material, I haven't found one
that comprehensively introduces the topics we'll cover (biomolecular
sequence, structure, and function) from a computational perspective.
Thus I'll distribute lecture notes and provide references to the
literature.</dd>

<a name="coursework"></a>
<h2>Coursework</h2>

<p>The course seeks to provide broad exposure to some important
algorithmic challenges and approaches in bioinformatics.  The lectures
and readings will provide a fairly general (for a ten-week course)
survey of the field.  As this is an introductory course targeted at
undergraduate and graduate students in computer science, a background
in biology is not required.  However, students should be interested in
learning some basic molecular biology and biochemistry, in
context.</p>

<p>Students from other related disciplines are encouraged to take the
course; it has been approved as an elective for MCB students and to
fulfill the applied math requirement for Thayer students.  Naturally,
a basic understanding of the underlying computational techniques is
expected.  The homework assignments require implementing
bioinformatics algorithms, so programming experience is necessary.
Please contact me to discuss your background and interests.</p>

<p>The course is dual-listed as CS 43 for undergraduate students and
CS 143 for graduate students.  Grades will be handled separately, and
each assignment specifies additional requirements for graduate
students.</p>

<p>The coursework consists of the following:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Homeworks (70%)</dt>
  <dd>Since one of the best ways to learn something is by doing it,
weekly programming labs for roughly the first two-thirds of the term will offer 
the opportunity to implement and apply some core bioinformatics
algorithms.  To standardize and enable us to provide some
infrastructure, labs will be done in <a
href="http://www.python.org/">python</a> (version 3.1); students have reported
that learning/practicing python is another valuable outcome of the class. <br />
In addition, graduate students will have the chance to practice their
skills at critically reading primary literature, with weekly short
critiques and discussion of papers related to the topics covered in class.</dd>
  
  <dt>Final project (25%)</dt>
  <dd>The final project provides the opportunity to more deeply
explore a topic of interest, individually or in a group, choosing
an appropriate mixture of research, implementation, and application.  A project
proposal and a project update will ensure that we are on the same
page; a project presentation will make for a fun class-wide exchange;
a project report will document what was done and what was learned.</dd>
  
  <dt>Participation (5%)</dt>
  <dd>This is some encouragement to participate in class (asking
questions, pointing out potential pitfalls, characterizing strengths,
etc.) as well as outside of class (suggesting examples, pointing out
significant applications and recent developments, finding related
materials, etc.).</dd>

</dl>

<p>Assignments are to be turned in via <a
 href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~blackboard/">Blackboard</a>
<em>before</em> class on the due date.  Ample time is provided for
each assignment, so in general, late submissions will not be accepted.
Under extenuating circumstances, arrangements must be made with the instructor
<em>before</em> the due date.</p>

<p><strong>Flu policy</strong>.  In keeping with Dartmouth's <a
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~prepare/swineflu/">flu response
effort</a>, <em>do not come to class</em> if you have flu-like
symptoms.  Contact me, and follow the <a
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~prepare/swineflu/response090809.html">prescribed
protocol</a>.  You do not need to do any sequence, structure, or
function analysis of your flu strain to be excused.</p>

<a name="honor"></a>
<h2>Honor code</h2>

<p>Dartmouth's honor code applies to this course, and academic
misconduct policies will be strictly enforced.  If you have questions,
ask!</p>

<p>You may discuss the programming labs with other current CS 43/143
students, but your submission must be entirely your own.  As part of a
discussion, you may show (in person) another student your work.
However, your submission must be created and documented by you alone.
You may not copy anything directly from another student's work.  For
example, copying a portion of someone else's solution onto a piece of
paper would violate the honor code, even if you eventually turn in a
different answer.  Similarly, e-mailing a portion of your code to
another student, or posting it on-line for them to see would violate
the honor code.  Although all students must create and type in their
own code, you may help other students debug their programs once you
and they have already written your programs.  Discussion of the labs
is encouraged, subject to these rules; such discussion will be most
useful when both students have already made serious attempts to solve
the problems on their own.</p>

<p>If you make use of any code that is not your own, you must clearly
attribute the source of the code with clear comments in the code that
you submit.  You do not need to acknowledge discussion with other
students on your submitted work.  Proper respect for copyright laws as
applied to printed materials and software products is subsumed by
Dartmouth College's <a
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/comp/about/policies/">Computing
Policies</a>.</p>

<p>Written paper critiques are to be done individually; class time
will be reserved for discussion after submission.</p>

<p>The final project may be conducted individually or in a group.
Here, collaboration is encouraged.  Building on existing code is
acceptable, subject to the above comments regarding attribution.</p>

<a name="access"></a>
<h2>Disabilities</h2>

<p>Students with disabilities enrolled in this course and who may need
disability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to make an
appointment to see the instructor before the end of the second week of
the term. All discussions will remain confidential, although the <a
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~accessibility/">Student Accessibility
Services</a> office may be consulted to discuss appropriate
implementation of any accommodation requested.</p>
