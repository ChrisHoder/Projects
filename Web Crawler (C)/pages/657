<h1>Exceedingly Dorky Quotation Marks</h1>

This sign used to be at the entrance to a Winn-Dixie supermarket in
Delray Beach, Florida (at Atlantic Avenue and Military Trail):

<p>

Why the quotation marks?  Did the store's management consider the term
to be colloquial?  Perhaps they would have preferred to write
<blockquote>For Your Convenience PLEASE TAKE A CONVEYANCE IN WHICH TO
PLACE YOUR GROCERIES Before ENTERING THE STORE</blockquote> Because of
the supermarket's location, many of its customers are elderly.  Maybe
the management thought that their customers had not heard of shopping
carts.

<p>

Possibly the conveyances in question are not <em>really</em> shopping
carts, and the quotation marks indicate that the store's management
was aware of this discrepancy.

<p>

Or, perhaps the sign was designed by dorks.
