<h1>Homework 4</h1>

<h2>Microcode</h2>
<p>
<hr>
<b> Q1 (15 pts)</b>
<hr>
<p>
In class last week, we implemented circuitry for a set of traffic
lights at a simple intersection.  Take the implementation we did in
class (<a href="trafficlights.circ"><b>trafficlights.circ</b></a>) and
reimplement it in ROM using the microcode approach.  Make your circuit
as simple as possible.  (although using the 3-alow-sr subcircuit is
100% ok)

<h1>Programming!</h1>
<hr>
<p>
We've been learning about machine language and assembler.  You have access
to assembly and simulation tools.  We've been demonstrating these tools in class
<p>
Now, it's time to use them!
<p>
<hr>
<b>Q6: Calender (45 pts) </b> (Via Prof. Yale Patt himself)
<hr>
<p>
Write a program in LC-3 assembly language that provides the day of the week for any date between January 1, 1901 and the present day.
<p>
Your program should start at address x3000, but will look these addresses for its arguments:
<ul>
<li> x31F0: the day of the month (a number from 1 to 31, decimal)
<li> x31F1: the month (a number from 1 to 12, corresponding to Jan to Dec),
<li> x31F2: the year (a four digit number)
</ul>
E.g., for today, that might be #4, #20, #2010
<p>
Your program should figure out the day of the week corresponding to this input date, 
and write the output (Sunday, Monday, ...,Saturday) on the console.
<p>
<b>Things to Note:</b>
<ul>
<li> <b>Minimize</b> memory accesses and make optimal use of the registers R1-5.
<li> Avoid using special purpose registers like R0, R6 and R7 in your code.
<li> Try to modularize your code by using subroutines (<a href=divide-2.asm>Sample assembly language program for division by 2</a>).
<li> Annotate your code with comments so that it is easy to understand.
</ul>
</p>
To assemble the file, do "lc3as divide-2.asm"; this will create divide-2.obj.
One can feed this obj file to the simulator by issuing "lc3sim-tk divide-2.obj".

 Send email to cs37staff@cs with the subject line "Homework 4
 Submitted".  Attach all relevant files.  If you use multiple files,
 packing the assignment into a single zip file is preferred.
