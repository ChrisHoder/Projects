<a name="LS"><b>LogiSim Tips</b></a>
<p>

We'll be using LogiSim (the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/logisim-gt-2009/"><b>Georgia Tech variant</b></a>) for our digital logic simulation work this term.
<p>
<ul>
<li> For OSX users, download <a href="LogiSim/Logisim.app.zip"><b>Logisim.app.zip</b></a>.  (We will see that this is installed on the 005 Macs)
<li> For Windows users, download <a href="LogiSim/Logisim.exe"><b>Logisim.exe</b></a>
</ul>
<p>
You can also download <a href="LogiSim/Logisim.jar"><b>Logisim.jar</b></a>
on any system with Java and run it with the command "java -jar Logisim.jar". <p>

You will probably
find <a href="LogiSim/LogisimTechnicalManual.pdf"><b>Logisim Technical
Manual</b></a> useful during this course.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>You must have at least Java 1.6 to run LogiSim.</strong>

<p>
For Mac OS X 1.5 or later, Java 1.6 should already be installed
through a software update.  If it's not, you'll need to get it from
the Apple website (try searching for e.g. "Java for Mac OS X 10.5".)

<p>
To see if you have Java 1.6 and/or if it is your default version of
Java, go to Applications->Utilities->Java Preferences and follow
instructions there.

<p>
Apple does not appear to support Java 1.6 on older versions of Mac OS
such as 10.4.11.  However, there are some third party solutions.  The
following link seems to discuss the issues:

<b>LC3 tools</b> 
<p>
First download <a href="archive.zip"><b>archive.zip</b> </a>  
<ul>
<li> <b>LC3 assembler and simulator</b> : This is in the "lc3tools" directory.
<p> After putting it in the right directory on your Mac, run 
<tt>./configure</tt> then <tt>make install</tt> (you may have to run <tt>sudo make install</tt>).
<br> For the simulator to work, put the correct path into the <tt>set path(lc3sim)</tt> line in the file <tt>lc3sim-tk</tt>.  Check this file before editing; <br>the
	installer may have added the correct path already (in which case you don't need to do anything).<br><br>
The <a  href="LC3_unix.pdf">manual</a> can come pretty handy too. 
<p>This might come in handy too : <a href="PattPatelAppA.pdf"><b>P&amp;P Appendix A </b></a>. 
<p> You should also change your PATH on your Mac so that you can run <tt>lc3as</tt>
and <tt>lc3sim-tk</tt> from anywhere in your machine. BASH users can do this:
<ul>
<li> First create a file .bash_profile through the terminal.
<li> Then add the line <tt>export PATH=$PATH:</tt> followed by the path of the directory you want to add.
<p>

</ul>
<li> <b>LC3 compiler</b>: This is in the "lcc-1.3" directory. Follow the following steps to install:
<ul> 
<li> Go to the lcc-1.3 directory and run configure : <tt>./configure</tt>
<li> Then <tt>make install</tt>
<li> The go to the install directory and copy <tt>lc3as</tt> from "lc3tools" directory.
</ul>
Usage: <tt> lcc -Wf-g0,';' C_file-name -o output-name.</tt>
<p> It may be convenient to add the following line to .bash_profile : <tt>alias lccx="lcc -Wf-g0,';'"</tt> (note: no spaces after -Wf)
<br> This way you just have to type <tt>lccx </tt> instead of the full thing.
</ul>
<p>

<b>UNIX and Linux</b>
<p>

Tools:
<ul>
<li> From your Linux account, you can access manual pages for most commands 
and functions with the <tt>man</tt> command, e.g.
<pre>
    man getpid
</pre>
will tell you about the <tt>getpid( )</tt> system call.
For an alternative interface, check out <tt>xman</tt>.
<p>
If you don't know what the command is, 
<tt>man -k</tt>
lets you look up manpages by keyword.  
In the response, the numbers in parens indicate section
numbers; use <tt>man -S</tt> to specify section.
<li> Life is much easier if you use an editor that recognizes
your syntax, and highlights and indents appropriately. 
<p>
I like 
<tt>emacs</tt>.  (There are various X-enhanced versions around.)
But your mileage may vary.
