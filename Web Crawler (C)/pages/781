<h1>Dobb's BBQ, Dothan, AL</h1>

Visited August 22.

<p>

Never in my life did I expect to visit Dothan.  It may be Alabama's
fifth-largest city, but it ain't much.  We went there with Karen
Rapkin to visit a friend of hers who lives there.

<p>

Apparently, there are a couple of BBQ places in town.  We asked the
clerk at our motel which place she liked, and she sent us to Dobb's.

<p>

It was bloody awful.

<p>

Clearly, the meat had been sitting out for a long time after it had
been cooked.  But this seemed like BBQ that would be disgusting even
if it had been fresh.  Dry, no flavor.  The sauce was very thick and
sweet.  We had combo platters, and the sliced pork, sliced beef, ribs,
and chicken were all terrible.  Nicole didn't touch her sliced beef
because she thought it was shoe leather.

<p>

The only acceptable item was the "camp stew,", which seems to be
called Brunswick stew everywhere else.  Acceptable, but not
particularly good.

<p>

I would have considered Dothan a washout, but there was some partial
redemption the next morning.  We all had breakfast at Krispy Kreme
doughnuts.  Krispy Kreme is primarily a southern chain, but Karen says
they have a couple of locations in New York City now.  Anyway, they
make yeast doughnuts (and I'm using their spelling, rather than
"donut") that are hot and fluffy.  And bathed in glaze.  They have a
big machine, prominently displayed, that makes the doughnuts.  It was
a fine breakfast.

<p>

And on our way out of town, across the street from Krispy Kreme, we
bought some boiled peanuts from Mr. Thadwick.  It was our first boiled
peanut experience, and although we'd been told that boiled peanuts
were terrible, we really liked them.

<p>

A few minutes later, we happened to pass Dobb's BBQ.  I hadn't taken a
picture the night before, because it was soooooo bad, but I figured,
when the hell am I ever gonna be in Dothan again?  Here's a photo of a
BBQ joint to avoid.
