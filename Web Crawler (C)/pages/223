<h2>Course description</h2> 

<p>This course will explore how computer science can help in the
rational design of proteins, drugs, and vaccines.  For example, in
protein design we will look at approaches for optimizing mutations, or
even entirely new proteins, to be harnessed in applications ranging
from biofuels to biosensors.  In drug design, we will study algorithms
for discovering new lead compounds, and for mining the relationships
between properties of molecules and their activities.  In vaccine
design, we will see how to train immunogenicity predictors and use
them to develop specifically targeted vaccines.  We will find that
these and other such applications raise numerous interesting and
challenging problems requiring the development of appropriate models
and algorithms.</p>

<p><strong>Prereqs</strong>: none.  In particular, a background in
biology / biochemistry is not required, and the basics will be
introduced in context.  At the same time, no specific CS courses are
required as prereqs, though readings and discussions will often assume
familiarity with core concepts (as in CS 5 and 8).</p>

<h2>Coursework</h2>

<p>This seminar course will introduce and study topics by way of
primary literature, from seminal papers to results hot off the
presses. All students will present papers and participate in
discussions; graduate students will also do paper critiques
(undergraduates are welcome to, since it's good practice). The seminar
will culminate in final projects offering the opportunity to dive more
deeply into topics of interest.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Presentations (30% undergrad; 25% grad)</dt>

  <dd><em>Critically</em> present the material in and underlying the
  reading, addressing the following:
  <ul>
  <li>The core problem and its context, including why other methods
  (computational and/or experimental) are insufficient.</li>
  <li>The approach, including how the computational methodology
  captures and helps address the problem.</li>
  <li>The validation of the approach, including how it is demonstrated
  to improve the state of the art.</li>
  <li>Strengths and weaknesses of the approach and the paper, and
  possible next steps.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Help everyone get the big picture and background (since much of
  the material will be new and challenging), and then provide your
  insights into the contribution. Try to engage everyone else in a
  discussion (see class participation below).</p>

  <p>Follow general advice on how to give a good talk (e.g., by <a href="http://www.cs.duke.edu/brd/Teaching/Giving-a-talk/giving-a-talk.html">Bruce
  Donald</a>, <a
  href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/tutorials/goodtalk.html">Hany
  Farid</a>, and <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/giving-a-talk/giving-a-talk.htm">Simon
  Peyton-Jones</a>).</p>

  <p>I will set up a queue of papers and solicit your preferences for
  when and what to present. I'm also glad to take your suggestions for
  specific papers on these topics that you would like to present (or
  would like to add to the queue).  In some cases, additional reading
  will be required to prepare a presentation; I'm glad to help
  identify materials.</p>
  </dd>
  
  <dt>Participation (20% undergrad; 15% grad)</dt>

  <dd>Don't leave the presenter dangling up there!  Read the paper(s)
  thoroughly before class, so that you also can have critical
  insights into the material.  Give your perspectives, ask and respond
  to questions, raise additional points, etc.</dd>

  <dt>Project (50% undergrad; 45% grad)</dt>

  <dd>Do an in-depth exploration of a relevant topic, worthy of
  (about) half the grade for the course.  The project may be done
  individually or in a group (recommended), and may include a project-
  &amp; student-appropriate mixture of research, implementation, and
  application.  A project proposal and a project update will ensure
  that we are on the same page as to the project's suitability; a
  project presentation will make for a fun class-wide exchange; a
  project report will document what was done and what was
  learned.</dd>
  
  <dt>Critiques (extra credit undergrad; 15% grad)</dt>

  <dd>For six different papers (two each from protein, drug, and
  vaccine design), not including what you present, write a
  <em>short</em> (at most a page) critique, including the points
  discussed above for presentations. Don't just repeat what you read
  in the abstract, introduction, and conclusion, but instead use your
  own background and experience for a unique critical perspective.
  Don't be overwhelmed by jargon and details, but try to cut through
  all that to the essence of the contribution.

  <p>This is essentially a short review, and there's also plenty of
  general advice out there for reviewing papers (e.g., by <a
  href="http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/2.55470">Alan
  Jay Smith</a> and
  <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=74090">Ian Parberry</a>).</p>

<h2>Honor code</h2>

<p>Dartmouth's honor code applies to this course, and academic
misconduct policies will be strictly enforced.  If you have questions,
ask!</p>

<p>As this is a seminar course, you are encouraged and expected to
discuss the material with others.  You are also encouraged to work in
teams for the project.  So the only real pitfalls are attribution: the
work you present as your own must in fact be your own.  In particular,
you must write your critiques yourself, in your own words.  You must
also create your own presentation slides, though you may incorporate
others' images and text, with citation.  And in your project, while
you certainly may use and build upon others' code, you must clearly
indicate what part is your contribution.</p>

<a name="access"></a>
<h2>Disabilities</h2>

<p>Students with disabilities enrolled in this course and who may need
disability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to make an
appointment to see the instructor before the end of the second week of
the term. All discussions will remain confidential, although the <a
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~accessibility/">Student Accessibility
Services</a> office may be consulted to discuss appropriate
implementation of any accommodation requested.</p>
