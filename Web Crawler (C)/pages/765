<b>Abstract:</b>
This paper describes the functionality of ViC*, a compiler for a
variant of the data-parallel language C* with support for out-of-core
data.  The compiler translates C* programs with shapes declared
outofcore, which describe parallel data stored on disk.  The compiler
output is a SPMD-style program in standard C with I/O and library
calls added to efficiently access out-of-core parallel data.  The ViC*
compiler also applies several program transformations to improve
out-of-core data layout and access.
