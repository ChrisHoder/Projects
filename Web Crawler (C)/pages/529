<h1>Background</h1>

<p>
This course is based on COSC88/188, which I taught in Spring 2001
and Winter 2002; we ran COSC38 the first time in Spring 2003.

<p>

I've had the opportunity to have professional experience doing
security analyses, research, design, and implementation in 
government, and industry, and academia.  
I've been crafting this course
for a mid-level undergraduate student, covering what I wished I had
known when I was starting out.
After this introduction, students can move on to 
more detailed research projects
in OS, systems, and cryptography;
and in the special topics course.

<p>
(Note: this course <b>has</b> been approved for graduate credit
as well.)
<p>


<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>
Commerce and government are rapidly moving from 
media such as paper (which we've had
several millennia to understand) to distributed, electronic systems
(which seem to change every six months).
<p>

The financial, political, and social importance of what these systems
do raises critical security and privacy issues.  
However, the rapidity of
this migration makes even stating these critical properties, let alone
designing and deploying systems that provide them, rather
difficult---as history shows. In this course, we will examine:
<ul>
<li>  what security and privacy mean in these settings; 
<li>  the techniques that might help; 
<li>  and the ways these techniques can nevertheless be used to build insecure systems. 
</ul>
<p>
We will loosely use the migration of 
paper processes to electronic
settings as a focus.  
<p>
<ul>
<li>  This focus raises the right issues.
<li>   This focus makes us look 
at the system as a whole, rather than on one particular piece.
<li>   Many of you will shortly go on to build such systems. 
<li>   Others may go on to perform vulnerability analysis on them. 
</ul>
This term, I plan to use the real-world systems of NH voting,
the North American power grid, and one other business enterprise 
as a framework.
<p>
<h1>Objectives</h1>

<p>
The course has two main objectives:
<ul>
<li>   Minimally, students should gain an awareness of the breadth of
   tools and topics that constitutes security in this emerging arena
   (and a healthy wariness from the way 
the computer science community has continually 
failed to achieve security and privacy goals).
<li>   Maximally, I hope that we might synthesize from this breadth and
   experience some new approaches for effective security architecture.
</ul>
<p>
