<p>
This is the standard place to get programs I have written.
Many of them have been used in academic courses.
Sometimes ex-students want to get a copy to use or modify for new work.
In any case all these programs carry the BSD <a href="bsd.html">copyright</a>.

<b>Compiler and compiler course</b>. 
This entry contains a teaching compiler written MATLAB 
and accompanying course materials
suitable for a 10 day industrial short course (16Mb compressed)
[<a href="mxcom20090603.zip">download</a>].
</li>

<li><b>xcom in C++</b>
This entry contains a teaching compiler written in C++.
It is an earlier version of the compiler written in MATLAB (above).
Some students choose to download the C++ version as a starting
point for a more serious compiler (200Kb compressed) 
[<a href="c++.zip">download</a>].
</li>

<li><b>Growing a Compiler</b>.
This entry contains a paper describing growing a compiler via bootstrapping
from small beginnings. 
The presentation is via the MATLAB publish feature but the
operational code of the compiler is written in C. 
The components used to generate the publish file are included.  
Some of them require 32-bit Intel X86 hardware to run correctly 
(600Kb compressed).
