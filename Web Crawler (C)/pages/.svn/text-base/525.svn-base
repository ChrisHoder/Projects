<b>Syllabus and Notes:</b>
</big><br>
<p>

Please note two things about the <a href="../lectures/"><b>syllabus page:</b></a>
<ul>
<li> It is a living document, and may be updated frequently
<li> To compensate for my poor penmanship, I will provide <b>online class notes</b>, linked from that page, by lunch
</ul>
<p>

<p>

<b>Graduate Credit:</b>
</big><br>
<p>
This course has been approved for graduate credit.  Like other
CS undergrad courses that can be taken for graduate credit, students
will need to complete extra work beyond the undergrad requirements.
Please let me know if you are doing this.
<p>

<b>Help:</b>
</big><br>
<p>
To get help, stop by or send email. You can also
set up an appointment for other times. I will try to respond to mail
messages within 24 hours.

<b>Public Lab Space:</b>
</big><br>
<p>
There is public lab space available in Sudikoff Room 001 and 003 for students
enrolled in computer science courses. 
You will need to arrange ID-card access to get 
into these labs and to get into the building in the evenings
and on weekends. If you don't have that already, you should see
Kelly Clark in 101 Sudikoff.  <b>Don't dawdle; it can take 24 hours
to turn access on.</b>

<b>Late Assignments:</b>
</big><br>
<p>
We have conflicting issues here:
<ul>
<li> Assigments are due when they are due; 
extensions are not fair to the students sufficiently 
diligent to complete their assignments on time.
<li> However, particularly for seniors, many 
students have interviews and off-campus grad school visits.
</ul>
To balance these issues, here's the policy:
<ul>
<li> Each student has two (virtual) "one-day late" coupons.
Each coupon is good for a 1-day extension on one project.
</ul>
Plan accordingly.
<p>
We may otherwise apply 
a "5% off per hour" late policy both to 
the written homework and to the programming projects.
<p>

<li> In-class final
</ul>

<b>Honor Code:</b>
</big><br>
<p>
The Dartmouth Honor
Code applies to your conduct in this course.  In particular, all
work submitted for credit must be your own.
You may discuss your
homework assignments and programming projects with your classmates, the
TA and with me. 
However, you should write up your own written homework solutions
and should not read or copy the solutions written by others (in
this or previous terms, at Dartmouth or elsewhere). 
<p>

The Dartmouth College policy on sources also applies to
this course, which means that all sources must be acknowledged,
whether allowed by the instructor or not.  For example, software
given to you by us must be acknowledged 
when incorporated into your work.<br>
<p>
(Whether you go into industry or academia or elsewhere,
it would be good to get in the habit of keeping track of and citing
all your sources anyway!)
<p>
<B>If you have any questions about the
honor code as it relates to CS 38, please come speak with me. 
Violations of the honor code will be treated seriously.</B>

<b>Students with Disabilities:</b>
</big><br>
<p>
I encourage students
with disabilities, including &quot;invisible&quot; disabilities
such as chronic diseases and learning disabilities, to discuss with
me any appropriate accommodations that I might make on their
behalf.
<p>
(If this may apply to you, I also urge you to discuss things with the
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/"><b>Academic Skills Center</b></a>,
if you haven't already.  They've set up a system where they keep
the "appropriate accommodations" on file---so you don't have to
discuss details with each new instructor!)
