		<h1>About</h1>

		<h2>Background</h2> 
	
		  <p>Since the Summer of 2009 I am an Associate Professor in <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu">Computer
		  Science</a> at <a href="www.dartmouth.edu">Dartmouth</a>, an Ivy League University, where my research interests
		  cover various areas of Computer Graphics. I arrived at Dartmouth as an Assistant Professor in the Summer of 2005.
		  Before then (2004-2005) I was a Visiting Assistant Professor in
		  <a href="http://www.cis.cornell.edu">Computing and Information Science</a> at <a href=
		  "http://www.cornell.edu">Cornell University</a>. I also worked (2002-2004) in the research division of <a href=
		  "http://www.pixar.com">Pixar Animation Studios</a> developing new algorithms used in various award winning
		  feature films (<em>Monster&#39;s Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Cars</em>).</p> 
	
		  <p>I received a Ph.D. in <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu">Computer Science</a> from <a href=
		  "http://www.cornell.edu">Cornell University</a> in 2002, working at the <a href=
		  "http://www.graphics.cornell.edu">Program of Computer Graphics</a>, and a Laurea degree in <a href=
		  "http://www.fis.unipr.it/">Physics</a> (equiv. to BS and MS) from the <a href="http://www.unipr.it">University of
		  Parma</a>, Italy.</p>
                 <p>I am the recipient of an NSF CAREER award in 2008, and an Alfred P. Sloan fellowship in 2009.</p> 

		<h2 class="vspace">Scholarly interests</h2> 
	
		  <p>The use of synthetic images is growing in importance in many applications, from engineering to fine arts, but
		  it is often limited by the human labor and expertise required to create synthetic environments. My long term
		  goal, as a scientist and educator, is to make the creation of synthetic imagery accessible to the largest
		  possible audience.</p> 
	
		  <p>Rather than attempting to address all aspects of scene modeling, a daunting task, my <a href=
		  "research.php">research interests</a> focus on investigating methods that simplify the design of 
		  objects' appearance, which comes from the interaction of surface materials and scene lighting, through the 
		  development of interactive rendering algorithms and intuitive appearance design interfaces. This research led to various
		  theoretical results and practical applications in the areas of interactive realistic rendering, user interfaces
		  and visual perception. This website includes a description of <a href="research.php">research projects</a> and a
		  comprehensive list of <a href="publications.php">publications</a>.</p> 
	
		  <p>To pursue my long term goal of making synthetic imagery more accessible, I have focused my <a href=
		  "teaching.php">teaching efforts</a> on exposing students to the relationship between the conceptual, technical
		  and aesthetic principles of image synthesis, through curriculum development, the creation of out-of-classroom
		  opportunities for undergraduates and the mentoring of graduate students. To focus these efforts I co-developed a
		  minor in Digital Arts at Dartmouth, that is taught by Computer Science together with members of the Studio Art,
		  Film Studies and Theatre departments. This websites contains more information on the minor as well as 
		  <a href="courses.php">all courses</a> I have taught in the past.</p>
