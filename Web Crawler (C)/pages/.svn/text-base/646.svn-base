<li> CLRS 29.2-3.  But also explain what the y values
     in the dual problem represent.  In particular, given
     a graph with V = {s, x, y, z} and edge weights: <p>
     <ul>
        <li> (s, x) = 10
        <li> (s, y) = 7
        <li> (x,z) = 15
        <li> (y,z) = 4
        <li> (y,x) = 2
     </ul>
     <p>Give the linear program, the dual, and the solution to 
     each.  (Hint - don't solve the LP using simplex!  You 
     can assign values to the x's and the y's based on what 
     they represent, and then can verify that all constraints
     are met and that the functions maximized and minimized 
     have the same value.)
     <p>
<li> CLRS 29.4-3.  The LP describing maximum flow the third edition 
     is closer to the version of flow that we saw in KT (no negative 
     flows), and is probably easier to use than the one in the second
     edition.  Show the LP and the dual
     on the graph given in the last problem replacing z by t (the sink)
     and interpreting the edge weights as capacities.  Give the 
     solutions to each.  (Again, don't use simplex to solve the LP.)
     <p>
<li> CLRS 29-1 b
     <p>
<li> CLRS 5.2-2
     <p>
<li> CLRS 5.2-5
     <p>
<li> CLRS 5.4-6.  Express the approximate fraction of the bins that are empty 
     in terms of e.  Also give the expected number of bins with exactly k
     balls.  How does this relate to hashing?  
<p>
<li> KT 13.5
</ol>
