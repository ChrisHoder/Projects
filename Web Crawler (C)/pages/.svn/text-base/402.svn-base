[<a href='javascript:nothing()' onclick='openWindow("<p><b>Christophe Weibel</b></p><p><b>Minkowski Sums of Polytopes: Combinatorics and Computation</b></p><p> Minkowski sums are a very simple geometrical operation, with applications in many different fields. In particular, Minkowski sums of polytopes have shown to be of interest to both industry and the academic world. This thesis presents a study of these sums, both on combinatorial properties and on computational aspects.<br>In particular, we give an unexpected linear relation between the f-vectors of a Minkowski sum and that of its summands, provided these are relatively in general position. We further establish some bounds on the maximum number of faces of Minkowski sums with relation to the summands, depending on the dimension and the number of summands. We then study a particular family of Minkowski sums, which consists in summing polytopes we call perfectly centered with their own duals. We show that the face lattice of the result can be completely deduced from that of the summands.<br>Finally, we present an algorithm for efficiently computing the vertices of a Minkowski sum of polytopes. We show that the time complexity is linear in terms of the output for fixed size of the input, and that the required memory size is independent of the size of the output. We also review various algorithms computing different faces of the sum, comparing their strong and weak points.</p>")'>Abstract</a>]

  <dd><b>Flow-Cut Gaps for Integer and Fractional Multiﬂows</b>

       [<a href='javascript:nothing()' onclick='openWindow("<p><b>Chandra Chekuri, Bruce Shepherd, Christophe Weibel</b></p><p><b>Flow-Cut Gaps for Integer and Fractional Multiﬂows</b></p><p> Consider a <i>routing problem</i> instance consisting of a <i>demand graph</i> H=(V,E(H)) and a <i>supply graph</i> G=(V,E(G)). If the pair obeys the cut condition, then the <i>flow-cut gap</i> for this instance is the minimum value C such that there exists a feasible multiflow for H if each edge of G is given capacity C. It is well-known that the flow-cut gap may be greater than 1 even in the case where G is the (series-parallel) graph K_{2,3}. In this paper we are primarily interested in the integer flow-cut gap. What is the minimum value C such that there exists a feasible integer valued multiflow for H if each edge of G is given capacity C? We formulate a conjecture that states that the integer flow-cut gap is quantitatively related to the fractional flow-cut gap. In particular this strengthens the well-known conjecture that the flow-cut gap in planar and minor-free graphs is O(1) to suggest that the integer flow-cut gap is O(1). We give several technical tools and results on non-trivial special classes of graphs to give evidence for the conjecture and further explore the primal method for understanding flow-cut gaps; this is in contrast to and orthogonal to the highly successful metric embeddings approach. Our results include the following:<br><ul> <li> Let G be obtained by series-parallel operations starting from an edge st, and consider orienting all edges in G in the direction from s to t. A demand is <i>semi-compliant</i> if its endpoints are joined by a directed path in the resulting oriented graph. We show that if the cut condition holds for a semi-compliant instance and G+H is Eulerian, then an integral routing of H exists. This result includes as a special case, routing on a ring but is not a special case of the Okamura-Seymour theorem. <li> Using the above result, we show that the integer flow-cut gap in series-parallel graphs is 5. We also give an explicit class of routing instances that shows via elementary calculations that the flow-cut gap in series-parallel graphs is at least 2; this is motivated by and simplifies the proof by Lee and Raghavendra. <li> The integer flow-cut gap in k-Outerplanar graphs is c^{O(k)} for some fixed constant c. <li> A very simple proof that the flow-cut gap is O(\log k^*) where k^* is the size of a vertex cover in H; this was previously shown by Günlük via a more intricate proof.</p>")'>Abstract</a>]
