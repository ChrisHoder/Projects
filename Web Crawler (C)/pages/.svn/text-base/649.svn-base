<h2><a name="desc"></a>Course description</h2>

Here's the ORC description of CS 110:
<blockquote>
Students will learn how to write technical papers in computer science,
how to present technical papers in a conference-talk setting, and how
program committees and journal editors evaluate technical papers.
Writing topics include the proper use of technical typesetting
software, organization of technical papers, and English usage.
Students will write technical papers, produce official course notes,
and give oral presentations.
</blockquote>

<p>

We'll focus mostly on writing.  Some of the writing issues we cover
will be specific to computer science or mathematics, whereas some will
be material that you should have learned in your freshman writing
course, but probably did not.

<p>

Second in prominence will be how to give talks.  Each enrolled student
will give a 20-minute (conference-length) technical talk.

<p>

We'll spend the least time on how reviewers evaluate papers.  We need
to cover this angle, however, since every paper you submit to a
conference or journal will be reviewed.  You should have an idea of
what your readers are looking for.

<h2><a name="goals"></a>Course goals</h2>

To be a successful researcher, you need to do more than just obtain
results.  You need to communicate your results to your research
community.  In order to do so, you need to write papers that are
accepted to conferences and journals.  Although poorly written papers
are sometimes accepted (too often, in my humble opinion), the odds of
a paper being accepted increase if the paper is well written.
Moreover, the odds of a paper being <em>cited</em> are much higher if
the paper is well written.

<p>

Alas, most of us did not choose computer science because we love to
write English prose.  Indeed, most of us seldom wrote prose during our
undergraduate years.  You might be rusty as a writer, and you almost
certainly need to learn how to write technical papers.  This course
will teach you how and give you practice in doing so.

<p>

We will cover the following writing topics:
<ul>

  <li> <em>Style</em>: How to construct sentences and paragraphs that
       are clear and concise.

       <p>

  <li> <em>Usage</em>: Which words apply in which situations.

       <p>

  <li> <em>Paper organization</em>: What sections to put in a paper,
       and what to put in each section.

       <p>

  <li> <em>Figures</em>: How to design illustrations that are simple,
       accurate, and effective.

       <p>

  <li> <em>LaTeX</em>: How to typeset your work using LaTeX correctly.

</ul>

<p>

As a computer-science researcher, you will occasionally give technical
talks.  Some talk-giving skills apply to any form of public speaking,
but others are specific to our field.  This course will teach you how
to give technical talks.  You will give one, and you will critique
talks given by others.

<h2><a name="prereq"></a>Prerequisites</h2>

From the ORC:
<blockquote>
Each student must submit a short expository piece to be evaluated by
the instructor at the start of the course; only those students meeting
a required level of competence will be permitted to take the course
for a grade.  Students should also have a Computer Science background
sufficient to understand research papers.
</blockquote>

<p>

I have posted guidelines for the <a
href="writing-test.html">expository piece</a>.  I need it by 5:00 pm
on Tuesday, January 5.  You will know by class time on Wednesday,
January 6 whether you have passed the writing test.

<h2><a name="methods"></a>Teaching methods</h2>

We will use a combination of lectures and discussion.  For the writing
topics, I'll present some material, then we'll discuss.  Then I'll
present more material, then we'll discuss, and so on.  For the segment
on giving talks, we'll talk about elements of good and bad talks, then
I'll present two talks&mdash;one intentionally bad and the other not
intentionally bad&mdash;and I'll ask you to critique them.  Then each
member of the class will present a talk, which the rest of the class
will critique.

<p>

We'll be running this course on the scribe system.  For each class
meeting that includes lecture or discussion, one student will be the
official scribe.  That student will take careful notes and write them
up beautifully in LaTeX.  Once the notes pass my muster, I'll post
them on the course website.  Depending on the enrollment, each student
will scribe somewhere between one and three times.  <em>Auditors might
be asked to take a turn scribing.</em>

<h2><a name="expect"></a>Expectations</h2>

Part of your grade will depend on class participation, and so I expect
you to attend classes.  Of course, you will occasionally have to miss
class for a good reason, such as attending a conference.  In order to
have good discussions, we need discussants.  I'm good at talking to
myself, but I'd much rather have you there.

<p>

The workload in this course will be moderate.  I'll ask you to read a
bit, but the reading will be about writing, rather than technical.
We'll have a few homework assignments.  And you'll have to write a
technical paper, with a draft due near the end of the term and the
final version due at the end of the term.

<p>

I will alter the <a href="#schedule">course schedule</a> as needed.
Among other things, it depends on how many students end up registered
for the course.

<h2><a name="texts"></a>Texts</h2>

I have selected the following books:

<ol>

  <li> Leslie Lamport, <i>LaTeX: A Document Preparation System</i>,
       second edition.  Required.  Although better LaTeX tutorials
       might be out there, Lamport's book is to LaTeX as K&amp;R is to
       C.

       <p>

  <li> Lyn Dupr&eacute;, <i>Bugs in Writing</i>.  Required.  A good
       usage reference, geared toward computer scientists.  You'll
       enjoy reading it all the more if you happen to like cats.

       <p>

  <li> Joseph M. Williams, <i>Style: The Basics of Clarity and
       Grace</i>, third edition.  Required.  The best book on writing
       style I've ever seen.  This book tells you how to diagnose and
       repair sentences that are grammatically correct and even make
       sense semantically, yet somehow seem off.  It has greatly
       altered the way I write.

       <p>

  <li> Justin Zobel, <i>Writing for Computer Science</i>, second
       edition.  Required.  I don't agree with everything that Zobel
       writes, but I agree with much of it.  This book will serve as a
       good starting point for discussion.

       <p>

  <li> William Strunk Jr. and E. B. White, <i>The Elements of
       Style</i>, fourth edition.  Recommended.  <em>The</em> classic,
       though a bit musty by now.  I prefer Williams as a style book
       and Dupr&eacute; as a usage book.

</ol>

<p>

In addition, we will use <em>your</em> writing as text.  I will ask
each of you to submit some writing, and the entire class will critique
some of the submitted writing.  Lest you think that I'm asking you to
do something I wouldn't submit myself to, fear not: you'll be
critiquing my writing before you critique your classmates' writing.

<p>

Here are other books that you might find useful and possibly even
enjoy:

<ol start="6">

  <li> Nicolas J. Higham, <i>Handbook of Writing for the Mathematical
       Sciences</i>.  It has a little that's specific to writing
       mathematics, a little on usage, and a lot on the process of
       writing a paper.

       <p>

  <li> Donald E. Knuth, <i>The TeXbook</i>.  Like Lamport's book, this
       book is to TeX as K&amp;R is to C.  I find this book a bit
       difficult to use, however, and the index is a quintessential
       example of TMI.

       <p>

  <li> Patricia T. O'Conner, <i>Woe Is I: The Grammarphobe's Guide to
       Better English in Plain English</i>.  Julie Sussman, the
       World's Best Technical Copyeditor, is a big fan of this book.

       <p>

  <li> William Safire, <i>Fumblerules</i>.  Safire's list of grammar
       and usage rules, each of which violates itself.  Example: "The
       passive voice should never be used."

       <p>

  <li> Lynne Truss, <i>Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves</i>.  If you were as
       fixated on your research as Truss is on punctuation, you would
       have graduated by now.

       <p>

  <li> Bill Bryson.  <i>Bryson's Dictionary of Troublesome Words: A
       Writer's Guide to Getting It Right</i>.  The most complete
       usage reference I've ever seen.  A true labor of love and
       cantankerousness.

       <p>

  <li> Edward R. Tufte, <i>The Visual Display of Quantitative
       Information</i>.  This book was an instant classic.  I don't
       agree with all of it, but it's certainly thought provoking.
       We'll discuss many of its positions when we talk about figures.

</ol>

<h2><a name="grading"></a>Grading</h2>

Your grade will be a weighted combination of the assignments,
presentation, paper, and class participation.

<h2><a name="honor"></a>Academic honor</h2>

The principle of academic honor applies in this course as in any other
course.  Work you submit must be your own, subject to requirements
that I state in each assignment.  If you need to work with someone
else, you must fully attribute with whom you worked.

<p>

<em>Believe it or not, I have had an academic honor violation come up
in a past version of this course.  I will not hesitate to bring any
suspected violations to the attention of the Dean of Graduate Studies,
and violators can expect to be suspended for some number of terms.  If
you have any question about whether you are in danger of violating the
principle of academic honor, please check with me before you do
something you'll regret.</em>

<h2><a name="needs"></a>Student needs</h2>

Students with disabilities enrolled in this course and who may need
disability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to make an
appointment to see me before the end of the second week of the term.
All discussions will remain confidential, although the Student
Accessibility Services office may be consulted to discuss appropriate
implementation of any accommodation requested.

<h2><a name="support"></a>Additional support</h2>

In addition to my office hours, you can get help at RWIT, the Student
Center for Research, Writing, and Information Technology, located in
183 Berry Library, a few feet south of the Reference Desk on the main
floor of Berry.  The RWIT tutors are trained to help you in all phases
of the composition process, including preparing talks.  Back when I
directed the Institute for Writing and Rhetoric, I was indirectly in
charge of RWIT.  Not every RWIT tutor will be able to help you with
your specific problems, but most of them will be able to help you in
some way.  The RWIT service is free.  You may either schedule an
appointment or walk in.  See <a
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~rwit/">http://www.dartmouth.edu/~rwit/</a>
for information and scheduling.
