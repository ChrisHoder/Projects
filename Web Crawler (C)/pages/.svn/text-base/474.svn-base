Objective: to become familiar with the elements of combinatorial logic... by seeing it for yourself!
<p>
Platforms: Use LogiSim.  It is installed in 003 and 005.  To install it on your machine, see the <a href="../../../resources/index.shtml#LS">resources</a> page.
<p>
Some ground rules (for this and future homeworks):
<ul>
<li> Get to know the  LogiSim "Help" menu.  The documentation is pretty good, and we like it when you try to debug circuits on your own before asking for help.
</ul>

<h3>Q1</h3>  (This is the only question for homework 0)
<hr>
<p>
Using only 2-input NAND gates, build:
<ul>
<li> a NOT gate
<li> a 2-input AND gate
<li> a 2-input OR gate
<li> a 2-input XOR gate
<li> a 2-input NOR gate
</ul>
Try to use the <b>fewest</b> NAND gates possible.
