                <p><strong>We present an intuitive and efﬁcient method for editing the ap- 
pearance of complex spatially-varying datasets, such as images 
and measured materials. In our framework, users specify rough 
adjustments that are reﬁned interactively by enforcing the policy 
that similar edits are applied to spatially-close regions of similar 
appearance. Rather than proposing a speciﬁc user interface, our 
method allows artists to quickly and imprecisely specify the initial 
edits with any method or workﬂow they feel most comfortable with. 
An energy optimization formulation is used to propagate the initial 
rough adjustments to the ﬁnal reﬁned ones by enforcing the editing 
policy over all pairs of points in the dataset. We show that this for- 
mulation is equivalent to solving a large linear system deﬁned by 
a dense matrix. We derive an approximate algorithm to compute 
such a solution interactively by taking advantage of the inherent 
structure of the matrix. We demonstrate our approach by editing 
images, HDR radiance maps, and measured materials. Finally, we 
show that our framework generalizes prior methods while providing 
signiﬁcant improvements in generality, robustness and efﬁciency. [<a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~fabio/publication.php?id=appprop08">pdf/video</a>]

                <p><strong>This paper presents an image editing framework where users use reference images to indicate desired color edits. 
In our approach, users specify pairs of strokes to indicate corresponding regions in both the original and the 
reference image that should have the same color “style”. Within each stroke pair, a nonlinear constrained para- 
metric transfer model is used to transfer the reference colors to the original. We estimate the model parameters by 
matching color distributions, under constraints that ensure no visual artifacts are present in the transfer result. To 
perform transfer on the whole image, we employ optimization methods to propagate the model parameters deﬁned 
at each stroke location to spatially-close regions of similar appearance. This stroke-based formulation requires 
minimal user effort while retaining the high degree of user control necessary to allow artistic interpretations. We 
demonstrate our approach by performing color transfer on a number of image pairs varying in content and style, 
and show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art color transfer methods on both user-controllability and 
visual qualities of the transfer results. [<a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~fabio/publication.php?id=ucct10">pdf</a>]</strong></p>
