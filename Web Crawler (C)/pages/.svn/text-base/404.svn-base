<h1>Counter-examples to the Hirsch conjecture</h1>

<dl>
<dt> <a href=posterHirsch.pdf><b>Poster</b></a></dt>
  <dd> This is a poster I made for the IPAM workshop
    <a href="http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/sm2011/">"Efficiency of the
Simplex Method: Quo vadis Hirsch conjecture?"</a>, presenting my
discovery of a 20-dimensional counter-example to the Hirsch conjecture.</dd>
<dt> <a href=25prismatoid.poly><b>25-vertex prismatoid</b></a></dt>
  <dd> This is a Polymake file of the 25-vertices
    prismatoid which leads to my counter-example in 20 dimensions.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The Hirsch conjecture stated that for any <i>d</i>-dimensional polytope
defined by <i>n</i> inequalities, there would be a path of length
    no more than <i>(n-d)</i> edges between any two vertices
    of the polytope.
</p>
<p>
    The Hirsch conjecture was disproven in 2009 by Paco Santos, who
    proved that there exists a 43-dimensional polytope defined by
    86 inequalities, such that a particular pair of vertices could
    only be connected by paths of length at least 44.
</p>
<p>
    The counter-example of Paco Santos was based on the very particular
    properties of a Minkowski sum of two 4-dimensional polytopes.
    I undertook the task to find other sums with the same properties,
    but leading
    to simpler counter-examples. Starting from another sum of Paco
    leading to a counter-example in 23 dimensions, I managed to find
    a sum leading to a counter-example in 20 dimensions. This is currently
    the lowest dimension for which a counter-example is known.
</p>
<p>
    Once we have a Minkowski sum with the required property, we create
    a 5-dimensional prismatoid, which is the convex hull of the two
    summands placed on parallel planes. The prismatoid has the
    property that any path connecting the two opposite facets
    has length 6. It can then be modified into a counter-example to
    the Hirsch conjecture, using the same method as with the original
    counter-example of Paco Santos.
