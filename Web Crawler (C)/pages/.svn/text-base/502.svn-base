<h1>August 3: Homework Solutions, Data Types, Operations</h1>

<hr><h2>0) Recap</h2><hr>

<hr><h2>1) Homework Solutions</h2><hr>
<p>The ARAM: Andrew's <a href="AndrewARAM.circ"><b>solution</b></a>.

<p>A Microsequencer for the traffic light: <a href="TrafficLights2.circ"><b>TrafficLights2.circ</b></a>.
<br>The Microsequener approach: Rather than driving the ROM via a
counter, store extra control bits to tell you precisely which state to
go to next.

<p>Assembly code for multiplication:
<ul>
<li>The naive way: <a href="mult1.asm"><b>mult1.asm</b></a>
<li>Better: make sure we're constantly adding the <i>bigger</i>
number: <a href="mult2.asm"><b>mult2.asm</b></a>
<li>Even better: add two at a time instead of one at a
time: <a href="mult3.asm"><b>mult3.asm</b></a>
<li>Even betterer:  ??? that's for homework this week.  A hint:  the improvement in mult3.asm can be exploited much more than it is.
</ul>

<hr><h2>2) More on C</h2><hr> 

Today, we'll start delving more into C by talking about data types and
operators.  Wednesday and Friday, we'll look deeply into how C gets
turned into LC-3 assembly code.

<p><b>Reminder</b> The C we'll go over in class is a <i>subset</i> of C.
Our primary goal is to see the C-->assembly transformation process and
see how some features of C get turned into assembly code.

<hr><h3>Data Types</h3><hr>
<b>int</b> 
<ul>
<li>an integer
<li>typically 2's complement
<li>usually native word size  (constrast with Java)
</ul>
<p>
<b>char</b>
<ul>
<li> a "character"
<li> binary encoding of said character
<li> one <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs37/resources/ascii.html"><b>ASCII</b></a> byte.  (again, different than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode"><b>Java</b></a>)
<li> chars as constants: use single quotes e.g.,  'F'
</ul>
<p>
<b>character string</b>
<ul>
<li>sequence of characters, terminated by x00
<li>character strings as constants:  use double quotes e.g., "I view the landslide of C use in education as something of a calamity. (Niklaus Wirth, 1993)"
</ul>
