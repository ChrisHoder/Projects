<h2>Q1: Build the LC-3 Datapath</h2>(40 points)
<hr>
<p>
Build up the part
of the LC-3 processor <a href="dpath.pdf"><b>shown here</b></a>.
(That is, everything except the FSM, the memory, the IO, and the
interrupt handling stuff.)
<ul>
<li> Use LogiSim "tunnel components" to handle your control signals.
<li> Use Table C.1 to determine how to hook up the inputs to the multiplexors.
(The options are listed in numerical order.)
<li> Add an extra control line, CLEAR, that clears all registers.
</ul>
Feel free to use your components from previous homeworks as well as LogiSim components.
<p>
<p>

<h2>Q2: Test!</h2>(10 points)
<hr>
<p>
Test your datapath. 
<p>
It might be useful to consider:
<ul>
<li> starting with some very simple hex I/O to simulate memory 
<li> having a bank of switches to drive the control lines
<li> having binary probes on the control signals
<li> having a few hex probes scattered around, to monitor buses
<li> having a way to spy on register values
</ul>
<p>
Wiggle the switches and see that you can move data
around.  Check for things such as:
<ul>
<li> broken connections
<li> lines that aren't wired per the table in the book
</ul>
<p>
 Then, find a partner and test each other's datapaths.  
<p>
<hr>
<h2>Q3: Add some Memory</h2>(30 points)
<hr>
<p>
Add RAM for your user code. You'll need:
<ul>
<li> 4K words, starting at x3000, for your user code.
<li> 1K words, ending at xEFFF, for your stack.
</ul>
<p>
<hr>
<h2>Q4: Add some IO</h2>(20 points)
<hr>
<p>
Implement (memory-mapped) IO by connecting the 
LogiSim TTY and keyboard components---and installing some glue so they 
behave as the LC-3 KBDR/KBSR and DDR/DSR.
<p>
(Refer to sections 8.2 and 8.3 (Patt & Patel) for more details about memory-mapped IO implementation.)
<p>
As usual, make sure you have a test harness for this---so you can convince Ranganath and James that you convinced yourself it worked.
