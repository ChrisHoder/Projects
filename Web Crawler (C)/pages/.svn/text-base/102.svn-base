<h2>Course Description </h2>
This course serves as an introduction to formal models of languages and computation.
Topics covered include finite automata, regular languages, pushdown automata, context-free languages,
Turing machines, computability, and NP-completeness.

The course has substantial mathematical content.
It is expected that a student who enrolls for this course 
<em>already knows how to write mathematical proofs</em> and is generally mathematically mature.
If a student passes this basic criterion and is interested in thinking philosophically about
what a computer can or cannot do, then this course should be great fun.

<h2>Lectures</h2>

Lectures are in 108 Kemeny in the 11 hour: MWF, 11:15-12:20.
X-hour is Tuesday 12:00-12:50.

<h2>X-hours</h2>
<p>
Since this course covers a lot of nontrivial material,
I will use all X-hours for lectures or quizzes.
It is <b>extremely important</b> that you have no other engagements during X-hours.
I will be away in India attending a conference and return to Dartmouth only on January 6.
So there will be no lectures on January 4 and 5, and our first lecture will be on Friday, Jan 7.

<h2>
Prerequisite</h2>
<p>
Computer Science 25 or a strong mathematical background and permission of the instructor.

<h2>Text</h2>
Required: <i>Introduction to the Theory of Computation</i>, Second Edition, by Michael Sipser.

<!--
<p>
The <a href="journal.html">Day by Day</a> page will tell you what
reading I expect you to do for each lecture.

<h2>Homework</h2>

There will be weekly homework assignments.  They usually go out on
a Wednesday and are due in class one week later; the first homework will be
assigned on Wednesday, January 12.  

<p>
A few points about the homework assignments:

<ul>
<li> <strong>Start early.</strong> Difficult problems are not
typically solved in one sitting.  Start early and let the ideas
come to you over the course of a few days.
<p>

<li> Use good mathematical notation to be <strong>rigorous and concise.</strong> 
<p>

<li> <strong>You can work with others.</strong> Some of the problems will be
difficult, and it might often be helpful to discuss them with
others.  Feel free to form study groups.  The idea, however, is for
<em>everyone</em> to understand the problems and experience
working through the solutions, and so you should not simply "give"
a solution to another classmate.  In particular, each student
should write up his or her own homework solutions and should
not read or copy the solutions of others.
For each problem, if you worked on that problem with anyone,
you should write down their names at the start of the solution
to that problem.
If you receive help from the professor or the TAs, be sure to acknowledge those names also.

<p>
<li><strong>Work on your own before talking to others:</strong>
Although, as I said above, you can work with others on the homework problems,
you will learn the most by first trying out each problem on your own.
Make as much progress as possible on your own before you meet with your
study group.  If you get used to working with others and
often don't come up with the solutions on your own,
you may do okay in the homework component of your grade,
but you will suffer in the exams and quizzes where you are strictly prohibited
from collaborating with anyone (see below under the section titled ``Exams'').
<p>

<li><strong> Protocol during office hours:</strong>
If you receive any help during office hours (from me or the TA), we require that
you don't take any notes during such help sessions.
The idea is that you should understand what we discuss and be able to reconstruct it later
to write up the solution on your own.
<p>

<li><strong>Challenge problems:</strong>
In some homeworks, I might assign challenge problems.
Your work on these doesn't help the grade.
I therefore encourage you to work on challenge problems
only after you have solved the regular problems as well as you possibly can,
and you enjoy additional challenge.
</ul>

<h2>Homework Lateness Policy</h2>
<p>
Homework is due at the <em>beginning of class</em> on the announced due date.
Late homework has an immediate 20% penalty
(unless you have a valid excuse and, unless impossible,
have discussed with me in advance), and 10% penalty per calendar day after that.
I will not accept a homework after the next homework is due, or after the final.
In this course, if you do not do homework on time,
you will soon find yourself overwhelmed, so please be regular with your work.


<h2>Quizzes</h2>

There will be two in-class, closed book, hour long quizzes on Thursday evenings.
<ul>
<li> Quiz 1: 7.00-8.00pm, Thursday, January 27.  Location: Carson, Room #60.
<li> Quiz 2: 7.00-8.00pm, Thursday, February 24.  Location: Carson, Room #60.
</ul>

<h2>Exams</h2>
There will be a midterm exam and a final exam, both of which will be
take-home.  Unlike the homework assignments, you may not discuss exam
problems with anyone, not even with the professor.

<p>
The midterm exam will go out on Wednesday, February 9 and will be due
before class starts on Wednesday, February 16.
The midterm exam replaces that week's homework.

<p>
The final exam will be a takehome exam.
It will be available on the web starting March 12
(more precisely, no later than 12.01am on March 12).
You will have 48 hours to work on the exam.
To accomodate everyone's schedule, I let each of you decide
when you want to start on the exam, but you must start
on the exam no later than 11.59am on March 14.
This way I can be certain that I have all of the exams back
before noon on March 16.

<p>
Before the final exam, we will have a review session 1.00-2.30pm on Friday, March 11
at Kemeny Hall Herringer Classroom 006.

<h2>Grading</h2>
Simple formula:
<ul>
<li> Homework: 35%
<li> Quizzes: 15%
<li> Midterm: 25%
<li> Final: 25%
</ul>

<h2>Honor Code</h2>
<strong>All work submitted for credit must be your own.</strong>
As explained below, the rules with regard to the extent of collaboration are different for homework and exams.
<p>

You may discuss the homework problems with your classmates, the
TAs, and Professor Jayanti,  but you must write up your own
solutions.  For each problem, you must indicate who else you worked
with or got any help from, small or big.  Even if you worked with the same people on the entire
assignment, be sure to write their names at the start of the solution of each problem.
Any written sources used (apart from the text, your lecture notes and any
homework solutions that I distribute) must also be
acknowledged; however, <strong>you may <em>not</em> consult any
solutions on the internet or from previous years' assignments, whether they are student-
or faculty-generated.</strong>

<p>

The rules are different for the exams (because
exams are where we find out what you have learned by doing the homework).
Unlike the homework, any discussion of the problems is prohibited for
the midterm and the final exams:
you may not discuss the problems with your classmates, the TA, the professor or anyone else.
You may not consult written sources other than
the text book, your class notes, and any homework solutions that I distribute during this term;
and you may not consult any electronic sources, including the internet.

<p>
You should consult a copy of <em>Sources, their Use and Acknowledgment</em>,
which can be found on the internet at www.dartmouth.edu/~sources

<p>
Dartmouth's Academic Honor Principle applies to this course.
Please be sure to read the principle, which you can find at
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~reg/regulations/undergrad/acad-honor.html"></a>.

<p>

Please ask me if you have any questions about the honor code as it
applies to CS 39.  Better safe than sorry!

<h2>Disabilities</h2>

Students with disabilities enrolled in this course and who may
need disability-related accommodations are encouraged to make an appointment
to see me on or before January 14.
All discussions will remain confidential, although the
Student Accessibility Services office may be consulted
to discuss appropriate implementation of any accommodation
requested.

<h2>Religious Observances</h2>

Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during
this acdemic term.  If you have a religious observance that conflicts with
your participation in the course, please meet with me
on or before Friday, January 14 to discuss appropriate accommodations.
