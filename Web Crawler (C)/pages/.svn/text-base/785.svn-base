<h1>Little Ponderosa, Harper's Ferry, WV</h1>

Visited August 28.

<p>

We stayed at an inn in Stanley, VA because we couldn't find a room we
liked in Luray, and we wanted to see Luray Caverns.  (Well worth
visiting, by the way, despite our tour guide whose enthusiasm level
was matched only by fans of the Montreal Expos.)  The inn wasn't too
bad, and we were the only guests there that night.  The innkeeper told
us about Little Ponderosa in Harper's Ferry, and we figured we'd try
it.

<p>

Harper's Ferry is quite the historical town.  Unfortunately, we have
no photos of it, or of Little Ponderosa, because our camera broke in
the midst of our Luray Caverns tour.  So we have only 4 photos of
Luray Caverns.

<p>

Anyway, Little Ponderosa is strictly tourist Q.  My pulled pork
sandwich had a slight smoky taste, but it was a skimpy portion for
$4.95.  (I could have gotten two excellent sandwiches for that price
at any of the <a href="lexington.html">Lexington Six-Pack</a>.)  The
sauce was too thick and sweet, although not as bad as <a
href="johnnyrays.html">Johnny Ray's</a> or <a href="dobbs.html">Dobb's
BBQ</a>.  Nicole got a pit beef sandwich that was so mediocre that she
didn't bother to finish it.  The meat wasn't dry, but it had no taste.

<p>

If we go back to Harper's Ferry, it sure won't be for the BBQ.
