<a name="LS"><b>LogiSim:</b></a>
<p>
We will be using the Georgia Tech version of the
LogiSim simulator for the exercises.
The tool will be installed 
on the machines in 005
(but you can also install it on your own
machine)
<p>
For more information, see the <a href="../resources/index.shtml#LS"><b>LogiSim material on the resources page</b></a>

<p><b>Note:</b> If you choose to run Logisim on your own machine, you do so at your own risk.  The cs37 staff only supports MacOS 10.5 and up.

<p><b>Also note:</b> Do not use Logisim on <b>Ubuntu</b> machines---students have had problems in the past.  Logisim tends to occasionally crash and/or save mangled circuits instead of nice, clean circuits. If you submit a circuit you've created using Logisim on a Ubuntu machine, do not be surprised if you get a low grade because your circuit is mangled.  You've been warned ;)
<p>
<hr>
<b>Late Assignments:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Each student has two (virtual) "one-day late" coupons.
Each coupon is good for a 1-day extension on one project.
<li> However, an N-person project requires N coupons for a 1-day extension.
</ul>
Plan accordingly.
<p>
If/after you burn through both coupons, I'll charge 
a 5% off per hour penalty.
<hr>
<b>Exams:</b>
<p>
<p>
<i>Midterms:</i> We'll be holding one midterm.  See the syllabus page for time/venue.
<p>
<i>Final:</i> scheduled by the registrar.
<p>
<hr>
<a name="grading"><b>Grading:</b></a>
<p>

<p>
Here's a rough breakdown of how your grade will be calculated:
<ul>
<li> homework projects: 45%
<li> final exam: 30%
<li> midterm:   20%
<li> classroom participation: 5%
</ul>
(This is subject to change.)
<p>
<hr>
<b>Honor Code:</b>
<p>
The Dartmouth Honor
Code applies to your conduct in this course.  In particular, all
work submitted for credit must be your own.
You may discuss your
homework assignments and programming projects with your classmates, the
course staff, and with me. 
However, you should write up your own written homework solutions
and should not read or copy the solutions written by others (in
this or previous terms, at Dartmouth or elsewhere). 
<p>
You should also write your own code and
not read code written by classmates.  <b>Do not look at another student's homework.</b>
<p>

The Dartmouth College policy on sources also applies to
this course, which means that all sources must be acknowledged,
whether allowed by the instructor or not.  For example, software
given to you by us must be acknowledged 
when incorporated into your work.<br>
<p>
<B>If you have any questions about the
honor code as it relates to CS 37, please come speak with me. 
Violations of the honor code will be treated seriously.</B>

<p>
<hr>

<b>Students with Disabilities:</b>
<p>
If you have any disabilities, including &quot;invisible&quot;
disabilities such as chronic diseases and learning disabilities,
please come see me so we can discuss possible accomodations I might
make.
<p>


(If this may apply to you, you should also discuss things with the
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~accessibility/"><b>Student Accessibility Services</b></a> office,  
if you haven't already.  They've set up a system where
they keep the "appropriate accommodations" on file---so you don't have
to discuss details with each new instructor!)
