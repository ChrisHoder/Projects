<H2>COSC 106: Numerical Linear Algebra</H2>
Fall 2009 <br>
MWF 1:45-2:50, Sudikoff 115
<p>

<li> <b> Course Outline </b>
<p>
This course is about how to solve, computationally,
linear algebra problems.  It is not a course to introduce
linear algebra (you are expected to already have some background
in this - see prerequisites), although we will review this material 
as needed and you might be asked to demonstrate understanding of this.
It is also not a course on the applications of linear algebra.
(For that, you could take COSC 36/136, for example.)
Rather, it is on how to solve those linear algebra problems that
you get in your applications: we will study the <i> algorithms </i> of 
linear algebra.  Or, to quote one of the authors of our textbook (see
the Appendix)
<p>
 ``Numerical analysis is the study of algorithms for the problems
of continuous mathematics.''  
<p>
Please read the Appendix of the text book before the second class for a
much more insightful and thorough discussion about what this course is about.  

<li> <b> Topics </b>
<p> 
This is a rough and tentative syllabus, that I have essentially copied
from the textbook we are using.
<ul>
<li> orthogonal vectors, norms, singular value decomposition
<li> QR factorization, Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, 
and least squares problems
<li> conditioning and stability
<li> Gaussian elimination and Cholesky factorization
<li> eigenvalue problems, Raleigh quotient, QR algorithm
<li> iterative methods: Arnoldi, Lanczos, conjugate gradient
<li> preconditioning
</li> </ul> <p>

<li> <b> Textbook </b>
<p>
This is the main text book.  We will also use supplementary material.

<li> <b> Prerequisites </b>
<p> Familiarity with linear algebra and with computers; 
"mathematical maturity" <p>

<li> <b> Additional Information </b>
<p>
There will be weekly homeworks, and two exams in this course.  
The homeworks will involve a mix of problem solving, proving, and 
programming in Matlab.

day of class.
