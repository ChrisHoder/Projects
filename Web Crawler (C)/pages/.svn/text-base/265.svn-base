<p> This course is designed as a follow-up to an introductory Theory of
Computation course, such as <a
href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~ac/Teach/CS39-Fall07">Dartmouth's CS
39</a>.  <b>Students who have not yet taken such an introductory course
are required to do so before registering for CS 109.</b>

<p> In <a href="www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~ac/Teach/CS39-Fall07">CS39</a>, we
learned that the Turing Machine is a powerful abstraction that helps us reason
about computation. In this course, we shall continue from where CS39 left off,
and delve deeper into the mysteries of the Turing Machine and study five key
aspects of computation: time, space, nondeterminism, randomness and
interaction. The goal is to understand the power of each of these. The
course is structured into three major phases, as indicated in the following
plan. </p>

<b>Announcements</b>
</div>
  <ul>
    <li> The final exam will be a take-home 24-hour time limited exam. You will have a period 
    of about 6 days during which to do it, and you get to choose any contiguous 24-hour 
    interval during which to work on the exam. Further details will be announced later, as 
    necessary. </li>
  </ul>

<div style="font-size:larger">
<b>Textbooks and Such</b>
</div>

<p> There is no set textbook for the course, so it is vital to attend
class. However, there are three reference books that cover just about
everything we shall do in class, and I will be updating the schedule
table above with appropriate references. These reference books are:
<ul>
  <li> <i>Introduction to the Theory of Computation (Second Edition)</i>. 
  Michael Sipser. Referred to above as [Sip]. </li>
  <li> <i>Computational Complexity</i>. Christos Papadimitriou. Referred
  to above as [Pap]. </li>
  <li> <i>Complexity Theory: A Modern Approach</i>. Sanjeev Arora and
  Boaz Barak. Available <a
  href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/theory/complexity/">online</a>. 
  Referred to above as [AB]. </li>
</ul>

<div style="font-size:larger">
<b>Administrative Details</b>
</div>

<p> <b>Your goal</b> is to earn at least <b>30 points</b> over the
course of the term, at least <b>6</b> of which must be earned from a
final exam. There are two ways to earn points.

<p> <b>Homework:</b> Starting Apr 8, there will be a short homework,
consisting of approximately 2 problems, given out after every class.
There will be a total of about 25 problems given out throughout the
term. Each problem will be worth 2 points. <b>I strongly recommend that
you solve each homework before the next class, as this will help in your
understanding of the next class.</b> By "solve", I mean solve for
yourself. You don't need to turn in everything, just turn in "enough" to
make progress towards the 30-point goal. If you score over 24 points
from your homeworks, the extra points will count towards extra credit.
</p>

<p> <b>Final exam:</b> This will be a take-home exam given out at the
end of the course. The maximum possible score in the final exam will be
10 points, so you will have to earn at least 20 points from turning in
homework solutions. </p>

<p> <b>Working together</b> is allowed on homework problems (except when
indicated otherwise), but not on the final exam. </p>

<p> <b>Getting Help:</b> This term, Amit has office hours Thu 4-5pm and
Fri 1:30-2:30pm. We have a teaching assistant, Ranganath Kondapally, who
has office hours Tue and Sun 2-8pm. Both of us are likely available at
other times as well; feel free to just drop in if we are around, or make
an appointment if you want a specific time. </p>
