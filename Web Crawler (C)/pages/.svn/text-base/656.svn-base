<h1><a href="index.html">CS 110</a><br>
Winter 2010<br>
Writing, Presenting, and Evaluating Technical Papers in Computer Science<br>
<i>Writing Test</i></h1>

In order to gain admission to CS 110, you are required to complete the
following assignment.  The purpose is to ensure that you already are a
somewhat competent writer of expository prose in English.

<p>

Write a description of <em>how to do something</em> (chosen from the
list of <a href="#topics"></a>topics below).  Your description must
adhere to the following rules:

<ol>
  <li> It must be written in English.

       <p>

  <li> It should be about two pages in length.  (I give this length as
       a guideline.  A little over or under is OK.)
 
       <p>

  <li> It should contain introductory material (at least one paragraph)
       telling me what I'm about to read and why I should care, and it
       should contain some concluding material (again, at least one
       paragraph) telling me what I just read and possibly foreshadowing
       related topics.  Between the introductory material and concluding
       material should appear the main material telling me how to do
       whatever it is you're telling me.

       <p>

  <li> The description should make no assumptions about my technical
       knowledge in the topic.  For example, if you write about how to
       change the oil in a car, do not assume that I know where the
       drainplug is or even <em>what</em> a drainplug is.
       
       <p>

  <li> It may be a PDF, a Microsoft Word file, or a plain text file.
       If it's a plain text file, put one blank line between
       paragraphs and create the file so that each paragraph takes one
       line in the file.
       
       <p>

  <li> To submit your description, email it to <a
       href="mailto:thc@cs.dartmouth.edu">thc@cs.dartmouth.edu</a> by
       5:00 pm on Tuesday, January 5.

</ol>

<h3><a name="topics"></a>Topics</h3>

Here is a list of suggested topics.  Please choose one:

<ol>
  <li> How to change the oil in a car.
  <li> How to select and buy a car.  (You may focus on either a new or
       a used car.)
  <li> How to make either fried chicken or kung-pao chicken.
  <li> How to grow tomatoes.
  <li> How to give a haircut.
  <li> How to win at Scrabble.
  <li> How to travel cheaply.
  <li> How to train a dog.
  <li> How to get a child to eat broccoli (or some other vegetable that
       children typically dislike).
  <li> How to drink substantial amounts of alcohol without the resulting
       hangover.
  <li> How to cure a hangover.
  <li> How to break up with your boyfriend or girlfriend.
  <li> How to get over it when your boyfriend or girlfriend breaks up
       with you.
</ol>

<p>

If you do not feel qualified to write about any of the above topics,
please see me and we'll come up with something about which you can
write.
