Lab 3 Readme


1) echo.c
   
   This function replicates the echo bash command. With the -n option. If a different
   option is used such as "-r" it will just echo it out normally as the
   echo function will. 

2) network.c
   
   when somebody inputs a command for the prompt, only the first letter will be read
   no matter how many characters are put in.

   When someone inputs  the the IP address. the code will check to see if any of the
   parts of the IP are greater than 255. Additionally if you input more after the
   IP address you will get an error caught by the fact that it will make the prefix
   command prompt not work. If it doesn't cause this error it will not matter because
   the parsing of the input will only take the <x.y.z.t> part.

   Addtionally for the automatic portion of the network program to work the bash
   script getadr.sh needs to be present and in the same folder. As well it needs
   to be able to create the file address.dat

3) sort.c

   This program assumes that the file given has numbers in it, where only one
   number is on each line and there is an arbitrary max number of numbers of 400
   and max length of the number 400.
   
   For the switches, you can input the same switch more than once and this will
   not change the function of the program but it does check to make sure that
   the switches are either -r, -u or -n. 

4) rps
   
   This can be compiled using the header file game.h, and to compile the function
   the header file game.h and the files main.c, printStart.c, gameStats.c,
   playGame.c, helpFunc.c, computerChoice.c, looseFunc.c, winFunc.c, tieFunc.c,
   userInput.c must be in the same folder to compile

   When running the function and the user is told to input their choice, only
   the first character will be read into the program and everything after
   that will be ignored.
